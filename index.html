                <h2>Turkey is a Hell for Journalists</h2>
                <p>For the real ones of course.</p>
                <p>
                    
                    Turkey has experienced a failed coup attempt in 2016 and many believe that it was a fake one organised by the government to strengthen its power.
                    The incident was very complicated and a lot of the things are still not clear.
                    Around <b>96,000</b> people got arrested after the incident. <b>231</b> of them were journalists. <b>Ahmet Altan</b> is just one of them.
                    <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/outrage-after-turkish-journalist-re-arrested-a-week-after-his-release"> 
                    He's been released twice and got re-arrested</a> a week after he was released.                    
                    <b>165</b> of those journalists are still under arrest, and <b>167</b> of their counterparts are wanted as of <b>May 8, 2020</b>.
                     

                </p>
                <p>
                    Currently, there is no free media in Turkey. 
                    All media outlets are under control of the government. 
                    The government also has a big influence on the justice system 
                    which uses against its opponents.

                    He's been aquitted twice but re-arrested and still in jail despite the fact that there is 
                    no sufficient evidence that shows he has committed a crime. 
                    The State dosn't provide any explanation as to why he is not being released.</p>

                    He was tortured to death under police custody.
                    Around a year and a half after his death, 
                    the Government issued a statement which cleared him of all charges and re-instated him to his teaching position. No kidding!

                    <em>Murderers</em>, <em>rapers</em>, and even <em>mafia leaders</em> have been released as a safety measure to the Covid-19 
                    but <em>babies, women, teacher, doctors, human rights defenders</em> have still been kept in jail. 
                    On top of that, 35-40 detainees have been kept in a room for 7.
                    Therefore, the number of the new cases are growing rapidly in the jails.
